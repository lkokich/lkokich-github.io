        <hr>
        My name is Lucas Kokich and I am a sophmore. I grew up in Tacoma, Washington and I have never lived anywhere else. I attended Saint Charles Borremeo for middle school, and then Bellarmine Prep for High School. I have 3 siblings consisting of one older brother and two sisters. I am now majoring in Finance but I dont know exactly what I want to do career wise yet. I am excited to see what the rest of my time here at Gonzaga has in store. 
        <br>
        I enjoy staying active, watching sports, and hanging with friends.
